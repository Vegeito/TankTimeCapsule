# Contributing to Shark Tank India Analytics

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Shark Tank India Analytics as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## 📝 Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the FEATURES.md if you've implemented a new feature
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers

## 🐛 Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)
